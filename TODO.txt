Thin Client Architecture
https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/ - for stepping throught the oAuth process

- Configure pgvector compatibility for Aiven
https://aiven.io/docs/products/postgresql/howto/use-pgvector

- refactor and rename /register endpoint, really more of a login endpoint register if new

- improve frontend performance
  - have the js cache some number of documents at a time. Only display titles but clicking is instant
  - include a button to load more, n at a time

- refactor CRUD endpoints to use less db ops
  - several areas are getting using email to get id, either cache in frontend (local storage)
  - or allow for using email in doc queries

- catch token expired errors, return redirect to index.html

- simulate a pub sub event with curl, ensure all else is working

- Dockerize the backend, test with the cointainer

- deploy to GCP, perform end to end tests

- Write the pub sub endpoint, recieves email to draft a response

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:
- MCP integration via programatically generated XML

- Set pub sub up in google console
